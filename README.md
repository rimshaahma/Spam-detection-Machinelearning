# Spam Detection Project

## Overview

The **Spam Detection Project** is an application designed to classify text messages as spam or non-spam (ham) using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes a **Streamlit** web interface for user interaction, and **NLTK** (Natural Language Toolkit) for text preprocessing and feature extraction. The machine learning model is built using **scikit-learn**, a popular Python library for machine learning tasks. The dataset for this project was sourced from **Kaggle**, which contains labeled messages to train the model. The application allows users to input text in real-time and provides a prediction on whether the text is spam or not.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Streamlit Interface**: The web application is built using Streamlit, offering an easy-to-use interface where users can input text and get instant predictions on whether the message is spam or not.
  
- **Text Processing with NLTK**: The project uses NLTK for essential natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as:
  - **Text cleaning**: Removing unwanted characters, punctuation, and stop words.
  - **Tokenization**: Splitting the text into words or tokens for further processing.
  - **Feature extraction**: Using techniques like **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** to convert the text into numerical features suitable for machine learning.

- **Spam Classification Model**: A machine learning model is trained using **scikit-learn** to classify text as either spam or non-spam based on patterns in the dataset. Common algorithms like **Naive Bayes** or **Logistic Regression** can be used for this task.

- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: The preprocessing pipeline includes:
  - **Data cleaning**: Handling missing values, converting text to lowercase, and removing special characters.
  - **Vectorization**: Converting text into numerical representations using TF-IDF or Bag of Words.
  - **Model training**: Training the classifier on the processed data using various machine learning algorithms.
  - **Model evaluation**: Evaluating the model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this project is sourced from **Kaggle**, and it contains labeled SMS messages categorized as **spam** or **ham (non-spam)**. Each message is represented by a label (1 for spam, 0 for ham) and a corresponding text message. The dataset is used to train and evaluate the machine learning model for spam detection.

To access the dataset, you can visit [Kaggle Spam SMS Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and download the dataset. Alternatively, the dataset may be included in this repository as `spam_data.csv`.

## Machine Learning Model

The machine learning model used in this project is a text classifier that predicts whether a message is **spam** or **ham (non-spam)**. Here's an overview of the approach:

1. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - **Tokenization**: The text is split into individual words (tokens) to create a meaningful representation.
   - **Stopword Removal**: Common words like "the", "is", and "and" are removed as they do not contribute to the meaning.
   - **Vectorization**: The text is converted into numerical form using methods like **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), which represents the importance of words in the text.

2. **Model Training**:
   - The preprocessed data is fed into a machine learning algorithm (e.g., **Naive Bayes**, **Logistic Regression**, or **SVM**). These algorithms learn the patterns that distinguish spam from non-spam messages.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1 score** to assess how well it classifies the messages.
